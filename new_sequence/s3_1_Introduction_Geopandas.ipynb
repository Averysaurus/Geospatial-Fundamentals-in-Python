    "> This lesson assumes you have basic working knowledge of Python and of geospatial data. If you need a geospatial refresher, we refer you to these freely available online resources:\n",
    "> - The Open Textbook Library: [Essentials of Geographic Information Systems by Jonathan E. Campbell and Michael Shin](http://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/BookDetail.aspx?bookId=67)\n",

    "Just so we are on the same page..\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Geographic data` is data about locations on or near the surface of the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Geospatial data`  is geographic data that can be explictly located on the surface of the Earth because it contains coordinates like latitude and longitude.\n",

    "### GeoPandas and related Geospatial Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "[GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) is a relatively new package that makes it easier to work with geospatial data in Python. In the last few years it has grown more powerful and stable. This really is great because previously it was quite complex to work with geospatial data in Python. GeoPandas is now the go to package for working with `vector` geospatial data in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Pro-tip**: If you work with `raster` data you will want to checkout the [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. We will not cover raster data in this tutorial.\n",

    "### GeoPandas = pandas + geo\n",
    "GeoPandas gives you access to all of the functionality of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which is the primary data analysis tool for working with tabular data in Python. GeoPandas extends pandas with attributes and methods for working with geospatial data.\n"

    "  - contain detailed geometry, big files\n",
    "  - not pretty for mapping\n",
    "  - good for spatial analysis\n",

    "    - e.g., tl_2018_06_tract.zip\n",
    "    \n",
    "  \n",
    "- [Cartographic Boundary files](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/naming-convention/cartographic-boundary-file.html): \n",
    "  - smaller file sizes, \n",
    "  - made specifically for mapping,\n",
    "  - have a `cb` in the file name when downloaded from Census web or FTP site\n",
    "      - e.g., cb_2018_06_tract_500k.zip\n",
    "  - have a mapping resolution at the end of the file name, \n",
    "    - eg `_500k` files look best around 1:500K map scale\n",

    "### Several ways to obtain Census Geographic data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fetch via API - although not all years may be available.\n",
    "2. Download from Census website or FTP site\n",
    "3. Download from another website like [NHGIS.org](https://nhgis.org)\n",

    "- `Counts`: display the count of observations aggregated by a feature, for example, the population within a census tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Density`: express the count within a feature by the of area of the feature, for example, population per square mile within a census tract, \n",

    "- `Proportions / Percentages`: compare the value of a part to the whole. For example, the proportion of the tract population that is white compared to the total tract population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Rates/ratios`: compare the relationship of one observation to another. For example the homeowner to renter ratio would be calculated as the number of homeowners (c_owners/ c_renters).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a choropleth map is to use color to visualize the spatial distribution of a quantitative variable.\n",

    "- [fiona](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona) - for spatial data file IO\n",

    "\n",
    "These packages may be installed as dependencies when you install Geopandas or you may need to install these directly.  We list the packages above for reference only in case you have questions about what is being installed on your system or need help getting Geopandas to run.\n"
