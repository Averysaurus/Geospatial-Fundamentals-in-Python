    "### About Census Geographic Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of census geographic data products: \n",
    "- TIGER/Line Files \n",
    "  - contain detailed geometry, big files\n",
    "  - not pretty for mapping\n",
    "  - good for spatial analysis\n",
    "  - have a `tl` (as in `T`IGER/`L`ine) in the filename when downloaded from Census web or FTP site.\n",
    "    - e.g., tl_2018_06_tract.zip\n",
    "    \n",
    "  \n",
    "- [Cartographic Boundary files](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/naming-convention/cartographic-boundary-file.html): \n",
    "  - smaller file sizes, \n",
    "  - made specifically for mapping,\n",
    "  - have a `cb` in the file name when downloaded from Census web or FTP site\n",
    "      - e.g., cb_2018_06_tract_500k.zip\n",
    "  - have a mapping resolution at the end of the file name, \n",
    "    - eg `_500k` files look best around 1:500K map scale\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Several ways to obtain Census Geographic data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fetch via API - although not all years may be available.\n",
    "2. Download from Census website or FTP site\n",
    "3. Download from another website like [NHGIS.org](https://nhgis.org)\n",

    "\n",
    "Census tract geographic data files are updated frequently to improve the quality of the spatial data, but the most significant updates happen for all census geographies just before the decennial census.\n",
    "\n",
