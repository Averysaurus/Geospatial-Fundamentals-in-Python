    "As a refresher, a CRS describes how the coordinates in a geospatial dataset relate to locations on the surface of the earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `geographic CRS` consists of: \n",
    "- a 3D model of the shape of the earth (a `datum`), approximated as a sphere or spheroid (aka ellipsoid)\n",
    "- the `units` of the coordinate system (e.g, decimal degrees, meters, feet) and \n",
    "- the `origin `(0,0 location), specified as the `equator` and the `prime meridian`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `projected CRS` consists of\n",
    "- a geographic CRS\n",
    "- a **map projection** and related parameters used to transform the geographic coordinates to `2D` space.\n",

    "\n",
    "- You need to know the data about your data (or `metadata`) to use it appropriately.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Some analysis methods expect geospatial data to be in a projected CRS\n",
    "  - For example, `geopandas` expects a geodataframe to be in a projected CRS for area or distance based analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some Python libraries, but not all, implement dynamic reprojection from the input CRS to the required CRS and assume a specific CRS (WGS84) when a CRS is not explicitly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most Python spatial libraries, including Geopandas, require geospatial data to be in the same CRS if they are being analysed together.\n",
