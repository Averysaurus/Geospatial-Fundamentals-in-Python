    "> This lesson assumes you have basic working knowledge of Python and of geospatial data. If you need a geospatial refresher, we refer you to these freely available online resources:\n",

    "Just so we are on the same page..\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Geographic data` is data about locations on or near the surface of the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Geospatial data`  is geographic data that can be explictly located on the surface of the Earth because it contains coordinates like latitude and longitude.\n",

    "### GeoPandas and related Geospatial Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "[GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) is a relatively new package that makes it easier to work with geospatial data in Python. In the last few years it has grown more powerful and stable. This really is great because previously it was quite complex to work with geospatial data in Python. GeoPandas is now the go to package for working with `vector` geospatial data in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Pro-tip**: If you work with `raster` data you will want to checkout the [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. We will not cover raster data in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoPandas = pandas + geo\n",
    "GeoPandas gives you access to all of the functionality of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which is the primary data analysis tool for working with tabular data in Python. GeoPandas extends pandas with attributes and methods for working with geospatial data.\n"
