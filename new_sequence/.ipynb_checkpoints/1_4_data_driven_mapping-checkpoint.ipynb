    "### About Choropleth maps\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of quantitative data variables that can be used to create a choropleth map. Let's consider these in terms of our ACS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Counts`: display the count of observations aggregated by a feature, for example, the population within a census tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Density`: express the count within a feature by the of area of the feature, for example, population per square mile within a census tract, \n",
    "\n",
    "- `Proportions / Percentages`: compare the value of a part to the whole. For example, the proportion of the tract population that is white compared to the total tract population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Rates/ratios`: compare the relationship of one observation to another. For example the homeowner to renter ratio would be calculated as the number of homeowners (c_owners/ c_renters).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a choropleth map is to use color to visualize the spatial distribution of a quantitative variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brighter or richer colors are typically used to signify higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big problem with choropleth maps is that our eyes are drawn to the color of larger areas, even even if the value being mapped is more significant in one or more smaller areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is exacerbated when the variable being mapped is a `count` rather than a standardized variable like density or percent. Large areas often have higher counts than smaller areas but not necessary higher densities, percents, or rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason it is considered best practice to create choropleth maps of standardized variables and not raw counts!"
